    Unit tests are included in the unittesting.py file.
    Breakdown of unit tests: 

    1 - test_read_data - this test will check that the read_data function can sucessfully
    read from the excel file and returns the data as a Pandas DataFrame

    2 - test_encode_income_groups tests that the encode_income_groups function to check 
    that the income categories in the wbincome2024 column are encoded correctly to numerical values. 
    E.g. it checks that high income is encoded as 4. If this is not found then the test will fail

    3 - test_calculate_average_mortality tests the function test_calculate_average_mortality to check
     that it calaulcates the mean estmate of mortality rates accurately by income group. It does this 
     by aserting that the computed values match the expected averages based on the filtered input data 

    4 - test_create_bar_chart_with_numbers verifies that the function test_create_bar_chart_with_numbers
    generates a bar chart of AIDS mortality rates by income group and checks that its saved as a PNG to the 
    output directory. This test checks that an output file exists 

    5 - test_create_line_plot tests that the function create_line_plot_by_income_group to check that 
    it creates a line plot of AIDS mortality trends over time and saves it correctly as a PNG file. 
    The test checks for the file's existence after the plotting operation.

    6 - test_correlation_analysis  Runs the correlation_analysis function to verify that it can 
    successfully perform correlation analysis on the encoded income groups and mortality estimates. 
    The output is printed to the terminal

    7 - test_statistical_analysis_pipeline tests the function statistical_analysis_pipeline to ensure that 
    it executes without errors and performs statisctial analyses on the filtered data. This will print output 
    to the terminal. 

    8 - test_avaerage_mortality_large_dataset tests the performance and checks the correctness of the 
    calculate_avaerage_mortality function when using a large dataset of 1,000,000 rows. This test will check 
    whether the output is not empty and verifies the processing time using a threshold.
